Preparing an application to be profiled
==================================

# Add a reference to the appender dll

If you're using .NET 4.0, you hsould add a reference to HibernatingRhinos.Profiler.Appender.v4.0.dll which is located in the downloadable zip.
If you're using .NET 3.5, .NET 2.0 or .NET 1.0, add a reference to HibernatingRhinos.Profiler.Appender.dll assembly instead of the HibernatingRhinos.Profiler.Appender.v4.0.dll one.

# Call the profiler from you cdoe

In the application startup (Application_Start in web applications, Program.Main in windows / console applications or the App constructor for WPF applications), make the following call:
HibernatingRhinos.Profiler.Appender.NHibernate.NHibernateProfiler.Initialize();


Profiling the application
=====================
Open the NHProf.exe
Start using the application you wish to profile
You should see the results immediately in the UI.

Notes
=====
This will work only when profiling on the current machine, you can profile a remote machine by passing the host name to the Initialize() call.
